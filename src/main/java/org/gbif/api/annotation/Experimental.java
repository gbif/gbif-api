/**
 * Experimental features are available but are not as robustly supported as other features.
 * <p>
 * In particular, experimental features:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Are not tested as well as stable features.
 * <li> Do not get bugs fixed as quickly as established features.
 * <li> The APIs could drastically change if we find a different, better way to solve the same problem.
 * <li> May disappear entirely if the feature is too difficult to support.
