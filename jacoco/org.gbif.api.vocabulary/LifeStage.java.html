   * A zygote (or zygocyte) describes the first stage of a new unique organism when it consists of just a single cell.
   * The term is also used more loosely to refer to the group of cells formed by the first few cell divisions,
   * although this is properly referred to as a blastomere.
   * A zygote is usually produced by a fertilization event between two haploid cells -
   * an ovum from a female and a sperm cell from a male -
   * which combine to form the single diploid cell.
   * Thus the zygote contains DNA originating from both mother and father
   * and this provides all the genetic information necessary to form a new individual.

   * A larva is a young (juvenile) form of animal with indirect development,

   * The larva can look completely different from the adult form, for example, a caterpillar differs from a butterfly.
   * Larvae often have special (larval) organs which do not occur in the adult form.
   * The larvae of some species can become pubescent and not further develop into the adult form (for example, in some newts).
   * This is a type of neoteny. It is a misunderstanding that the larval form always reflects the group's evolutionary history.
   * It could be the case, but often the larval stage has evolved secondarily, as in insects.
   * In these cases the larval form might differ more from the group's common origin than the adult form.
   * The early life stages of most fish species are considerably different from juveniles and adults of their species and are called larvae.

  /**
   * A spore is a reproductive structure that is adapted for dispersal and surviving for extended periods of time in unfavorable conditions.
   * Spores form part of the life cycles of many bacteria, plants, algae, fungi and some protozoans.
   * A chief difference between spores and seeds as dispersal units is that spores have very little stored food resources compared with seeds.
   * Spores are usually haploid and unicellular and are produced by meiosis in the sporangium by the sporophyte.
   * Once conditions are favorable, the spore can develop into a new organism using mitotic division,
   * producing a multicellular gametophyte, which eventually goes on to produce gametes.
   * Many ferns, especially those adapted to dry conditions, produce diploid spores.
   * In this case spores are the units of asexual reproduction, because a single spore develops into a new organism.
   * By contrast, gametes are the units of sexual reproduction, as two gametes need to fuse to create a new organism.

  /**
   * In plants and algae that undergo alternation of generations, a gametophyte is the multicellular structure, or phase, that is haploid,
   * containing a single set of chromosomes.
   * The gametophyte produces male or female gametes (or both), by a process of cell division called mitosis.
   * In mosses, liverworts and hornworts (bryophytes), the gametophyte is the commonly known phase of the plant.
   * An early developmental stage in the gametophyte of mosses (immediately following germination of the meiospore) is called the protonema.
   * In most other land plants the gametophyte is very small (as in ferns and their relatives)
   * or even reduced as in flowering plants (angiosperms), where the female gametophyte (ovule) is known as a megagametophyte
   * and the male gametophyte (pollen) is called a microgametophyte.

  /**
   * A gamete is a cell that fuses with another gamete during fertilization in organisms that reproduce sexually.
   * In species that produce two morphologically distinct types of gametes, and in which each individual produces only one type,
   * a female is any individual that produces the larger type of gamete — called an ovum (or egg) —
   * and a male produces the smaller tadpole-like type — called a sperm.
   * This is an example of anisogamy or heterogamy, the condition wherein females and males produce gametes of different sizes.
   * In contrast, isogamy is the state of gametes from both sexes being the same size and shape, and given arbitrary designators
   * for mating type. Gametes carry half the genetic information of an individual, one chromosome of each type.
